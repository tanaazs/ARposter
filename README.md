# ARposter

This is my Unity project for the AR Poster Project submission. 
It is an AR of an old, retro car. On pointing the camera to the image the retro car should pop up in its 3D form. 

I have attached all the necessary files on the google drive link below. The apk part of it isn't done since I had a few technical issues with that part of it. Everything else works well.
